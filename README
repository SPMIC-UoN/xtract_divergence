## XTRACT xtract_divergence
# xtract-ing divergence metrics from blueprints

# contains: 
# xtract_divergence - the code for calculating divergence metrics
# divergence_examples.sh - example calls of xtract_divergence
# data, viewing_files and examples of divergence maps and divergence-based predictions


########### Examples of divergence across species
# includes whole-brain divergence, myelin map predictions and ROI translation
# exampled with KLD, "shifted" KLD and JSD

# Note: we focus on human-to-macaque translation

# KLD = Kullback-Leibler divergence (with addition of small value to blueprint for better behaved divergence maps)
# KLD_bias = old-style KLD, has issues with zeros in blueprints
# JSD = Jenson Shannon divergence


###### directory contains:
# group-average blueprints for human (50 subjects) and macaque (6 subjects)
# blueprint entropy maps (mapping vertex-wise fingerprint complexity)
# whole-brain divergence maps
# measured myelin maps and myelin map predictions
# human example "seed" ROIs, divergence from ROI-averaged blueprint to whole-brain macaque (i.e. the prediction), and the target macaque ROI
# examples for ROI prediction: MT, M1+S1, sub-thalamic nuclei
